## Using the notebooks for your homework
You should be using [Google Colab](https://github.com/khider/INF549/blob/master/Getting%20Started%20with%20Google%20Colab.pdf) to run the notebooks and answer the questions in a separate Word Document (with appropriate screenshots).

## Running locally
If you want to run the notebook locally, please refer to
["Instructions about Installing Jupyter Notebook"](https://github.com/khider/INF549/blob/master/Instructions%20about%20Installing%20Jupyter%20Notebook.pdf)
You will be responsible for installing all dependencies on your own.
